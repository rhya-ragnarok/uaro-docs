# Class Changes
uaRO uses the pre-renewal class system, with selected adjustments to skills and mechanics for balance and smoother gameplay. These changes preserve the classic feel while improving the overall experience.

For full reference on unmodified pre-renewal skills, you can [visit the external classic wiki](https://irowiki.org/classic/Main_Page).

### Bag of Gold Coins
Bag of Gold Coins (`#670`) can be acquired at the Blacksmith Guild in Geffen (`/navi geffen_in 100/174`) for
50,000,000z. It reduces the cost of Mammonite and Cart Termination to 500z when held in your inventory. It has
a weight of 500 and cannot be dropped, put in cart, traded, mailed, sold, or put in guild storage. It can be
put in your personal storage. Limited to one bag per character.

**Avarice (Platinum Skill):** For an additional 200,000,000z, Whitesmiths can permanently trade in the bag to
learn the Avarice platinum skill. Avarice removes the zeny cost of Mammonite and Cart Termination entirely for
that character, with no weight detriment, and survives skill resets - it is re-granted automatically by the
Platinum Skill NPC.
